Such behavior is also a part of the harassment.  \\n(iii)  An informal approach to resolve a complaint of harassment may be \\nthrough mediation between the parties involved and by providing \\nadvice and counseling on a strictly confidential basis;  '),\n",

The request may be made orally or \\nin writing;  \\n(v)  If the case is taken up for investigation at an informal level, a senior \\nmanager from the office or the head office will conduct the investigation \\nin a confidential manner. The alleged accused will be approached with \\nthe intention of resolving the matter in a confidential manner;  \\n(vi)  If the incident or the case reported does constitute harassment of a \\nhigher degree and the officer or a member reviewing the case feels \\nthat it needs to be pursued formally for a disciplinary action, with the \\nconsent of the complainant, the case can be taken as a formal \\ncomplaint;  \\n(vii)  A complainant does not necessarily hav e to take a complaint of \\nharassment through the informal channel. She can launch a formal \\ncomplaint at any time;  \\n(viii)  The complainant may make formal complaint through her incharge, \\nsupervisor, CBA nominee or worker's representative, as the case may \\nbe, or directly to any member of the Inquiry Committee. The Committee \\nmember approached is obligated to initiate the process of investigation. \\nThe supervisor shall facilitate the process and is obligated not to cover \\nup or obstruct the inquiry;  \\n(ix)  Assist ance in the inquiry procedure can be sought from any member of \\nthe organization who should be contacted to assist in such a case;  \\n(x)  The employer shall do its best to temporarily make adjustments so that \\nthe accused and the complainant do not have to in teract for official \\npurposes during the investigation period.

During the \\nprocess of the investigation work, evaluation, daily duties, reporting \\nstructure and any parallel inquiries initiated should be strictly monitored \\nto avoid any retaliation from either side;  \\n(xii)  The harassment usually occu rs between colleagues when they are \\nalone, therefore usually it is difficult to produce evidence.

Currently,there is no other mechanism of this kind that exists within the international legal framework.Through this review, states are given the opportunity to highlight the steps they have takenin the promotion and protection of human rights while at the same time providing the spaceto focus on actions that need to be taken to address violations. \\nThis mechanism also provides NGOs and other stakeholders the opportunity to engage with\\nand influence the review process by providing information that is considered during a state’sreview.

Despite shortcomings inthe manner in which women were nominated to the reserved seats, thesystem was a springboard for numerous women to enter provincial levelpolitics.

It is important to note thatPakistan considered this recommendation as neither a universally recognizedhuman right nor in conformity with its existing laws, pledges andcommitments, and therefore did not accept it\\n26.\\n8.2 ‘Honour’ killing is a term used to denote the murder of women (and men)under the pretext of restoring the family’s honour. These murders are alsoperpetrated within the context of property disputes and the inheritancerights of women.\\n8.3 According to the HRCP Report for the year 2011, “at least 943 women werekilled in the name of honour, of which 93 were minors. The purportedreasons given for this were illicit relations in 595 cases and the demand tomarry of their own choice in 219 cases. The murderers were mostly brothersand husbands, in 180 cases the murderer being a brother and in 226 casesbeing the husband of the victim. The majority of cases (557) were of marriedwomen”\\n27. \\n8.4 Currently, as per the law, murder is primarily a crime against the personrather than a crime against the State and is governed by the provisions ofQisas and Diyat introduced in the criminal law in the year 1990 as part ofthe effort to ‘Islamize’ laws in Pakistan. These changes redefined the offencesof murder and manslaughter along with their punishments in ‘Islamic’terms and the provision for retribution or blood money was made available.The introduction of the Qisas and Diyat provisions have provided astatutory right to the heirs of the deceased to pardon the killer/s, ask forcompensation or demand retribution. These provisions have also exemptedsome relations from any mandatory imprisonment sentences. A parent cankill a child or a grandchild and the only sentence under the law is bloodmoney, though the Court has the discretion to sentence the accused toimprisonment for twenty-five years depending upon the facts andcircumstances of the case. There is no minimum sentence mentioned in thelaw. In practice, however, it is rare for a parent to be sentenced withimprisonment for killing their own child.

These provisions prove handy in cases of ‘honour’ killings as\\nthe majority of such murders of women in Pakistan are committed byfamily members who either benefit from these provisions or are ‘forgiven’by the heirs of the deceased.\\n8.5 The Government of Pakistan has introduced some measures to combat‘honour’ killings and gender discriminatory legal practices, however, the corelegal problems in relation to ‘honour’ killings have not been addressed. Theamendments introduced in the criminal law in January 2005\\n28did not prove\\neffective, as the key loopholes within the law were not plugged. Until theprovisions of Qisas and Diyat are revoked the perpetrators of ‘honourkillings’ will not fear retribution and Pakistan would be unable to complywith its international obligation of discouraging discrimination againstwomen. \\n9.

The practice of marryingwomen to the Quran in order to deprive them of their right to inheritancecarries a sentence of three to seven years.

Pakistan ranks 99 out of 109 countries in the GenderEmpowerment Measure\\n2and has a Gender Inequality Index value of 0.573,\\nranking it 115 out of 146 countries in the 2011 index3.

TheGovernment of Pakistan has acknowledged the need to tackle patriarchalmindsets and for further legislative reform to address the problem ofviolence against women and ensure the protection of women’s rights\\n6. It is\\na matter of concern however, that in its response to comments as the Stateunder Review, Pakistan was mostly silent on the issues of jirgas\\n7and the\\nprovisions under Qisas and Diyat with regard to cases of honour killings or,at best, buried said issues under generalized blanket women-centricresponses. \\n2.

Data indicates that womenon reserved seats are among the most active in the Provincial and NationalAssemblies and in the Senate. Of the 71 private member bills that wereintroduced in 2008-09, 57 were introduced by women on reserved seats, ofwhich 8 introduced in 2008 directly related to women.

In cases of violence and discrimination, women ofthese religious minorities face double jeopardy because of their gender andreligion. This is a matter of serious concern resulting in multiple socialproblems including abduction, forced conversion and marriages of non-Muslim women from the Hindu and Christian communities with Muslimmen. Conversions of non-Muslim women to Islam are often accompaniedby violence and coercion\\n24. Forced conversion of Hindu women to Islam is\\non the rise; Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported anaverage of 25 forced conversions per month\\n25in Pakistan despite the\\nguarantee of freedom of belief and equal protection before the law underthe Constitution. Law enforcement officers fail to cooperate with the familiesof abducted and forcibly converted women. These conversions are mostlyreported only in the case of women who are kept from meeting their families.A collusion of local landlords and influential persons with religious zealotsis being seen to operate in Sindh to keep women under the control of theirabductors. These problems are further compounded as legislation pertainingto their personal laws is not available.\\n7.3 Hindu married couples face numerous problems when travelling and lodgingoutside their place of residence. Moreover, Hindu women are deprived oftheir right to property and other rights conferred upon a divorced orwidowed woman; have difficulty in accessing heath facilities; and are unableto contribute to social, economic and political processes. Hindus have longbeen demanding legislation to register Hindu marriages, and in 2011 a Billwas presented in the National Assembly to pass a law to register Hindumarriages but so far there has been no progress. A 5% quota in all FederalGovernment jobs for minorities was also allocated by a notification on 26May 2009 but its application is not visible.\\n7.4 In November 2009, when the National Database and RegistrationAuthority (NADRA) rejected a Hindu woman’s request for a marriagecertificate on the grounds that ‘no such mechanism or legislation was inplace’, the Chief Justice of Pakistan took suo moto action and directed the\\nGovernment to legislate on the issue of Hindu marriage registration.

Women’s Rights in Pakistan – An Overview\\n1.1 Women’s rights and empowerment measures in Pakistan continue to fall\\nshort of projections and promises despite some positive steps to amelioratetheir condition. Pakistan ranks 99 out of 109 countries in the GenderEmpowerment Measure\\n2and has a Gender Inequality Index value of 0.573,\\nranking it 115 out of 146 countries in the 2011 index3. Reported incidents\\nof violence against women increased from 7,571 in 2008 to 8,5394by 2011\\nand while the adult literacy rate in Pakistan is 56%, female literacy standsat 40%\\n5despite the Government’s commitment under the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) to 87% women’s literacy by 2011. TheGovernment of Pakistan has acknowledged the need to tackle patriarchalmindsets and for further legislative reform to address the problem ofviolence against women and ensure the protection of women’s rights\\n6. It is\\na matter of concern however, that in its response to comments as the Stateunder Review, Pakistan was mostly silent on the issues of jirgas\\n7and the\\nprovisions under Qisas and Diyat with regard to cases of honour killings or,at best, buried said issues under generalized blanket women-centricresponses. \\n2. Women’s Poli/gid19fcal Par/gid19fcipa/gid19fon\\n2.1 The current representation of women in National Parliament andProvincial Legislatures is ensured with 17% seats reserved for women.Women occupy 22.2 % seats in the National Assembly, 17% in theSenate of Pakistan and 126 out of 728 seats (17.6%) in the ProvincialAssemblies.\\n2.2 Reserved seats are a welcome and necessary step. Data indicates that womenon reserved seats are among the most active in the Provincial and NationalAssemblies and in the Senate. Of the 71 private member bills that wereintroduced in 2008-09, 57 were introduced by women on reserved seats, ofwhich 8 introduced in 2008 directly related to women. Similarly, in 2010-11, the majority of the bills were introduced by women on reserved seats\\n8.\\nThese women challenged social and cultural norms and introduced billsagainst domestic violence, women trafficking, discriminatory practicesagainst women, and bills pertaining to women’s reproductive rights.

However, in reality customary\\npractices dictate what women are allowed to own, and their right toinheritance is easily evaded under family and social pressures. Generally, inall four provinces of Pakistan, according to customary practice, women donot inherit property and widows customarily lose their right to inheritanceif they remarry outside the family of the deceased husband, even though thelaw prescribes a prompt division of the deceased’s assets and the widow’sright to her share\\n31.\\n9.3 Another practice is that of haq bakhshwana (giving up rights, literally)\\nwhereby girls are either never married, or married to the Quran in order toprevent property going out of the family. Similarly cousin marriages and watta\\nsatta (exchange marriage whereby one set of brother and sister are married to\\nanother) marriages are designed to prevent break up of property as the size ofland and property is associated with power and status\\n32. Even though the\\nlegislative provisions dealing with a woman’s share in the property remainunchanged, the recent amendments in criminal law related to prevention ofanti-women practices have criminalized the practice of depriving women oftheir right to inheritance. The relevant Penal Provisions stipulate that theoffence of depriving a woman of her inheritance by deceitful or illegal meanswould be punishable with imprisonment, which may extend from five to tenyears or with a fine of one million rupees or both. The practice of marryingwomen to the Quran in order to deprive them of their right to inheritancecarries a sentence of three to seven years. An oath by the woman to remainunmarried or not to claim inheritance is also covered by this provision. Theeffective application of this law remains to be seen.\\n10.
